- make sysinfo a package
- implement sysinfo.sys and sysinfo.dbus

	class System:
		can_daemonize(): bool
		get_battery_state(): string
		get_battery_level(): int
		get_wifi_state(): bool
		get_bluetooth_state(): bool

- listen on DBus for events
	- Bluetooth: can't be toggled over DBus, but checked via:
		org.bluez /org/bluez/hci0 org.bluez.Adapter1 .Powered
	- Wifi: can be controlled via
		org.freedesktop.NetworkManager /org/freedesktop/NetworkManager org.freedesktop.NetworkManager .WirelessEnabled
	- either fallback from DBus to Sys or chain System implementations
